                        <p>All firms have a capital structure consisting of equity, debt, or a combination of both. Equity finance is provided by shareholders, while debt finance is provided by lenders. Some capital structure theories, such as the trade-off theory, suggest that firms aim to identify an optimal mix of equity and debt financing. This optimal point is where the firm balances the benefits and costs of each source to achieve an acceptable risk–return balance for both shareholders and finance providers.</p>
                        <p>Maintaining this optimal capital structure is important because an increase in risk, from either equity or debt, increases the firm’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and reduces the value of the firm, as well as potentially harming its reputation with finance providers.</p>
                        <p>In practice, firms are often able to take on more debt than equity as a source of finance. This is because debt holders receive contractual interest payments and have priority over equity holders in liquidation, which reduces their risk and therefore their required rate of return. In addition, interest payments on debt are tax-deductible, creating a tax shield. As a result, debt finance is generally cheaper than equity finance. However, if the firm takes on excessive debt and lender risk increases, this benefit is reduced or lost.</p>
                        <p>Increases in risk are not limited to high levels of debt. Agency costs may arise where management act in ways that are not aligned with shareholder objectives, leading shareholders to increase their required rate of return. This can also signal higher risk to lenders, increasing their required return. Furthermore, the choice between short-term and long-term finance, and between different types of equity or debt, also affects the firm’s risk profile.</p>
                        <p>Poor management decisions and inappropriate financing choices can therefore lead to required returns becoming so high that potentially profitable projects are rejected, limiting not only financial performance but also long-term firm growth.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the pecking order theory suggests that firms prefer to finance investment first using retained earnings, then debt, and lastly new equity. This is due to information asymmetry, as issuing new equity may signal to the market that management believes the firm’s shares are overvalued.</p>
