                        <h1>Objectives of the Firm</h1>
                        <p><b>Stakeholders and their interest</b> – in whose interest is the firm run? - The question raised would be either by the interest of the shareholders, or stakeholders. But, in the grand scheme of things, a firm is run with multiple interested parties being the focus. There are customers, creditors, employees, managers, society, and shareholders. However, the main objective of a firm is to meet the desires of the shareholders.</p>
                        <p>The firm is run based on the interest of the shareholders, as the owners of the firm. But there is a difference between the interest they have, and their pursuit of this. Meaning, in a firm, the shareholders are simply investors, some don’t have the professional knowledge or experience to run a firm – at least, not in the way that would achieve their interests. Therefore, in achieving this, the shareholders employ ‘Managers’ or as we call them ‘Agents’ - where the job of an agent is to align the firm with the interests of the shareholders, however, it does not come without it's challenges because shareholders delegate decision-making to managers, in which a potential conflict of interest arises – known as the agency problem – where managers may pursue their own goals rather than maximising shareholder wealth.</p>
                        <p>Friedman (1970) encapsulates the principle by imploring managers as shareholders’ agents to: “conduct business in accordance with shareholders’ desires, which will generally be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society, both those embodied in law, and those embodied in ethical custom”.</p>
                        <p>Now that we’ve established that the running of a firm is to align with shareholders’ desires, let’s consider how this looks from the financial side. It is assumed that the firm should make investment and financing decisions with the aim of maximising long-term shareholder wealth. But why? Because shareholders take on the risk, so they should get the reward. The more practical reason would be that decision making regarding investments and how the firm is financed, is easier when there is only a single objective to achieve – but can we run a firm like this?</p>
                        <p>Well, before we can answer that question, we need to look at how maximising shareholder wealth is achieved. The aim of wealth maximisation is to maximise shares price, and dividends – which is commonly measures by total shareholder return (TSR). In which there are two types of returns shareholders can achieve, as mentioned, capital gains from shares price being higher when you sell than when you buy, and dividends.</p>
                        <p>To put this into perspective, imagine you own 1,000 shares in ABC Plc. You initially paid £2.10 per share on day 0, and that share price rose to £2.40 per share on day 365, and on top of that £0.15 per share was given as a dividend at the end of the financial year too.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Purchase:</b> (£2.10 * 1,000) = £2,100.</li>
                            <li><b>Selling:</b> (£2.30 * 1,000) = £2,400.</li>
                            <li><b>Dividend:</b> (£0.15 * 1,000) = £150.</li>
                            <li><b>TSR:</b> ((£2,400 - £2,100) + £150) = £450 or 21.42%</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Now maximising shareholder wealth is, as we can see, worthwhile, but is there other possible objectives? Historically, profit maximisation was king, but not necessarily in line with shareholder wealth maximisation. What about maximising revenues too?</p>
                        <p>We see some issues with the objective of profit maximisation, for example;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Historic measure:</b> Profit is based on the past performance of the firm, like previous financial statements, whereas, shareholders are interested in the future performance of their returns, not just what’s happened previously. Additionally, last year we may have seen a firm perform extremely well, but if in the current year we see a drop in growth, or demand, the share price is likely to not increase.</li>
                            <li><b>Accounting Problems:</b> Profit is subjective based on many factors, for one, accounting policies – like depreciation methods, the way we valuate inventory, or recognise our revenue sources. Two firms could make the same level of sales, have the same level of expenses etc, but if they utilise opposing accounting decisions, like mentioned, their performance on paper is different to each other. This ultimately gives insight into the imperfect measure of real economic performance that is the measurement of profit.</li>
                            <li><b>Communication:</b> The measurement of profit doesn’t give the full story to shareholders. For example, £1 million in from selling off assets is less sustainable than £1 million from recurring sales, and if firms don’t communicate its sources of profits, or its ability to make them recur, investors may misjudge the value.</li>
                            <li><b>Prospects:</b> The focus of profit maximisation is short-term, but shareholders only care about the future growth, for example, Amazon when it was in its early years – little profits but huge growth opportunities. Profit maximisation ignores the growth prospects entirely.</li>
                            <li><b>Risk:</b> Profit maximisation does not take into account the risk element of earnings, for example, £1 million profit from a risky project is not the same as from a low-risk and stable operation. Shareholder wealth makes an adjustment in this regard – known as “risk-return trade-off”, whereas profit does not.</li>
                            <li><b>Additional Capital:</b> A firm can increase profits by raising more capital and scaling up, but this does not guarantee that existing shareholders are better off as a result. What matter to shareholders is ROE/ROCE, not absolute profit. Profit maximisation ignores whether returns justify the risk and cost of capital required.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The thing to consider is that not all shareholders are the same, we do have some that are more focused towards stability, and predictability – some being more focused on the business side, than the financial side. Here are a few to consider;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Remuneration (Income Focused):</b> Some shareholders prefer a regular attractive dividend that they can depend on, not just analysing the market to sell higher than what they bought (making a gain). For example, retirees or pension funds. This option is the opposite to growth investors because it can reduce reinvestment (less demand).</li>
                            <li><b>Empire Building (Expansion Focused):</b> Some shareholders prefer to focus on the size of the company, like it’s assets, influence, and reach, not just the profitability it can achieve – which can further the future the investment they make in the firm. Expansion may lower immediate returns and increase risk and can conflict with income focused or risk-adverse shareholders.</li>
                            <li><b>Employees (Harmony Focused):</b> Some shareholders are focused on maintaining the flow of the firms' activities, by ensuring there is harmony with employees – like prioritising the avoidance of strikes, agitation, or mass redundancies. This can lead to reduced profits and increased expenses to support bonuses, further incentives, etc.</li>
                            <li><b>Survival Focused:</b> Some shareholders value stability and continuity within the firm, which can result in less returns for other shareholders. This can sometimes mean cutting dividends, avoiding risky investments, and more a focus on liquidity – which goes against growth-focused investors.</li>
                            <li><b>Quality Focus:</b> Some shareholders focus on the prioritising of product/service quality (normal business activities), even if it results in less profit margins. This can affect the shareholders focused on the short-term, but for long-term shareholders, it can assist in the brand value and market share of the firm.</li>
                            <li><b>CSR/ESG Objectives:</b> Some shareholders focus on the sustainability, reputation and ethical practices that the firm has, which can result in higher costs and ultimately lowering profits, but it can protect the long-term value by lowering regulatory risk, reputation, and customer loyalty.</li>
                            <li><b>Lower Risk Preference:</b> Some shareholders focus on stability, and predictable returns, even if they are lower as a result of taking on less risk. This can cause a clash with growth focused shareholders who want to take on the risk-reward projects.</li>
                            <li><b>Market Share Maximisation:</b> Some shareholders focus on market domination, usually by cutting prices and aggressively reinvesting. This can reduce short-term profits and dividends, but it increases the long-term value, especially if market dominance is achieved.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The differences in Shareholder priority means that not everyone will be in agreeance on what wealth maximisation would look like. Too much of a focus on a sole preference could reduce the value for the others – for example;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>High dividends now mean less reinvestments for future growth.</li>
                            <li>A focus on growth means lower short-term payouts.</li>
                            <li>CSR focus means lower profits for the short-term, but better long-term survival.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This is exactly where the agency problem and corporate governance jump in, as in, managers (or Agents) try to balance the potentially multiple shareholder objectives and priorities while making sure there is long-term value.</p>
