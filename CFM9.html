                        <p>Companies often trade internationally, meaning they buy or sell goods/services in currencies different to their home currency. Because exchange rates fluctuate, the value of those transactions (in home currency) becomes uncertain.</p>
                        <p>Some of the Key Currencies are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>UK: Pounds Sterling.</li>
                            <li>Eurozone: Euro.</li>
                            <li>USA: Dollar.</li>
                            <li>Japan: Japanese Yen.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These and other currencies trade on the global FX markets, and their value moves like any other market-based price.</p>

                        <p>Changes in these values directly affect how many UK pound sterling a company will pay/receive when dealing with US Dollars.</p>

                        <h1>Measuring Currency Performance</h1>
                        <p>To measure the performance of currencies, we use a formula to determine out home currency performance, and foreign currency performance.</p>
                        <p><u>Home Currency Performance:</u></p>
                        <p>(Closing Rate / Opening Rate) -1</p>
                        <p>For example: YR1 to YR2:</p>
                        <p>(1.3754 / 2.0774) -1 = -33.8% (Negative)</p>
                        <p>I.e., The pound weakened against the dollar by 33.8% in comparison with the year prior.</p>
                        <p><u>Foreign Currency Performance:</u></p>
                        <p>(Opening Rate / Closing Rate) -1</p>
                        <p>For example: YR1 to YR2:</p>
                        <p>(2.0774 / 1.3754) -1 = 51% (Positive)</p>
                        <p>I.e., The dollar strengthened against the pound by 51% in comparison with the year prior.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h1>Spot Rates: Bid and Offer</h1>
                        <p>A spot rate is the exchange rate for immediate delivery of one currency for another. For example, banks will quote two rates, the bid is the rate that the bank will buy the base currency, and the offer is the rate that the bank sells the base currency. The difference between the banks buy and sell rate is their margin and spread.</p>
                        <p>The difference - the spead, exists to compensate for the banks market risk, liquidity risk, and admin/profit margins.</p>
                        <p>For example</p>
                        <p>US Dollar to UK Pound: Bid of 1.5761, Offer of 1.5765.</p>
                        <p>Bid = The bank buys currency from you.</p>
                        <p>Offer = The bank sells the currency to you.</p>
                        <p>Easy rule is that the customer will always lose the spread, that is always retained by the bank.</p>
                        <p>Midpoint is: (Bid + Offer) / 2</p>
                    </div>

                            <li>Example: receiving $ later when £ strengthens, means fewer £ received.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><u>Translation Risk:</u></p>

                            <li>Does not usually affect cash flow.</li>

                        <p>The firm is receiving $2 million in 3 months time. Because the exporter will sell in dollars, we divide using the higher rate (i.e., offer).</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>The £ strengthens and thus we receive less £, i.e., £6,434 lost profit.</p>

                        <p>The firm must pay £5 million in 2 months time. Because importer will buy in dollars, we divide using the lower rate (i.e., bid).</p>
                        <p>Over time:</p>
                        <ul>

                        </ul>

                        <p><u>Information</u></p>
                        <p>The UK exporter will receive 10 million Hong Kong currency in 3 months time, but that currency may weaken between now and them, therefore, a money market hedge is where we 'lock in' the today home currency value of Hong Kong value (referred to as 'Receipt') using: borrowing, conversion, and investment. This removes the exchange rate uncertainty completely.</p>
                        <p><b>Option 2: Money Market Hedge</b></p>
                        <p>In this option, there are three steps, with the last being based on how we'd like to use that money.</p>
                        <p>Step 1 is to borrow the forign currency, Step 2 is to convert the foreign currency to home currency, and Step 3 is how we're going to use it.</p>
                        <p><u>Step 1</u>: the borrow.</p>
                        <p>The idea here is to borrow, but we know that we'll be incurring interest, therefore, if we borrow the present value today, in three months time, the borrowed amount (principal) and the added interest, would make up the 10 million we're set to receive. This means that in three months when we do receive the 10 million, it's automatically paid off as the interest is embedded in the final payment amount (the receipt).</p>
                        <p><u>Step 2</u>: the conversion.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of converting the foreign currency immediately is to lock in its home currency value. If conversion were delayed, movements in the exchange rate could result in fewer home currency being received, whereas early conversion fixes the amount with certainty.</p>
                        <p><u>Step 3</u>: the spending.</p>
                        <p>The converted funds may be used either to reduce existing domestic borrowing, generating a return equal to the interest saved, or placed on short-term deposit to earn interest during the hedging period. I.e., aim is to use it to either reduce interest costs or increase interest income.</p>
                        <p><b>Option 3: Lead Payment</b></p>
                        <p>In this option, there are three steps too, with the last being based on how we'd like to use that money.</p>
                        <p>Step 1 is to offer a discount, Step 2 is to convert the foreign currency to home currency, and Step 3 is how we're going to use it.</p>
                        <p><u>Step 1</u>: the discount.</p>
                        <p>The aim is to encourage early payment by the customer by offering a discount (reducing sales revenue). This is a way to accelerate the cash inflow, but it shortens period of exposure to FX risk, but only if the exchange rate does not change negatively between when agreement it made, and payment date.</p>
                        <p><u>Step 2</u>: the conversion.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of converting the foreign currency immediately is to lock in its home currency value. If conversion were delayed, movements in the exchange rate could result in fewer home currency being received, whereas early conversion fixes the amount with certainty.</p>
                        <p><u>Step 3</u>: the spending.</p>
                        <p>The converted funds may be used either to reduce existing domestic borrowing, generating a return equal to the interest saved, or placed on short-term deposit to earn interest during the hedging period.

                        <p>Used to offset receivables and payables within a group so only the net amount is exchanged. A company has a subsidiary in each Hong Kong, Germany, and UK – net off using a single currency.</p>
                        <p>For example: we’ll use UK sterling with a UK company being the parent, and the others being subsidiaries.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HK owes UK 500k</li>
                            <li>Germany owes HK 1,200k</li>
                            <li>UK owes Germany 600k</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Exchange rate is: £1 = 12 HKD and 1.20 Euro.</p>
                        <p>We need to convert these to UK Stering as UK company is the parent:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Becuase HK owes UK 500k, that's already in UK sterling, so we leave that as is.</li>
                            <li>Germany owes (in HKD) HK 1.2 million, so we convert HKD to UK Sterling: (1.2m / 12) = 100k</li>
                            <li>UK owes (in Euro) Germany 600k, so we convert Euro to UK Sterling: (600k / 1.20) = 500k.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We then need to move the net amounts in a single transaction to prevent making multiple transactions. Therefore:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HK owes UK 500k and is due 100k from Germany, makes net -400k (HK).</li>
                            <li>UK owes HK 500k and is due 500k from Germany, makes net 0.</li>
                            <li>Germany owes HK 100k and is due 500k from UK, makes net +400k (Germany).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The net position is settled by HK paying Germany 400k. i.e, net is 0 across the board.</p>
                        <p>On that note, remember: negative net = payer and positive net = receiver.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, we've reduced 3 transactions to 1 transaction by exchanging the net amounts.</p>
                        <p><b><u>Lead/Lag Payments</u></b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lead: pay early if expecting exchange rate to worsen.</li>
                            <li>Lag: delay payment if expecting rate to improve.</li>
