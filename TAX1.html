                            <p>A tax is a complusory financial charge imposed on a taxpayer by a government organisation. A toll, levy and duty are all tax terms. We have both direct and indirect forms of taxation;</p>

                            <p><b>Why do we pay tax?</b></p>
                            <p>Taxes are a form of income for the Government, and is used to support the economy in several sectors, including;</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Education</li>
                                <li>Healthcare</li>
                                <li>Tansport</li>
                                <li>Emergency Services</li>
                                <li>Building Roads and Bridges</li>
                                <li>Defence Services</li>
                                <li>Social Services</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>There are also environmental taxes, which are used to deter certain activities, and enourage others. For example, "sugar tax" has been imposed on firms that's product sugar content is past a certain threshold. The Government posed them with either paying the sugar tax, or reducing the sugar contents - this in turn was able to target those with diabetes etc, and having them put less pressure on healthcare services. We also have other environmental charges like the plastic bag charge, fast fashion tax, vehicles tax etc.</p>

                            <p>Every October, the "Chancellor" releases a budget. We also have the spring statement every March/April. And we have Finance Act 2024 tax year/fiscal year. And any other legislation.</p>
                            <p>Scotland has been a devolved Government since 1999, which means we have the power and responsibility over the majority of public services in Scotland.</p>
                            <p>Not all taxes are fully devolved - Scotland has different tax bands and tax rates for income tax compared to the rest of the UK but it is essentially the same tax. For example, LBTT is the Scottish equivalent of the Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT).</p>
                            <p>We have HMRC who are responsible for collecting, paying, administering and enforcing taxes. When a tax advisor completes a tax return and files this on behalf of a client, this goes directly through the government gateway system to HMRC. HMRC then recalculates the tax liability/refund and issues a final summary to the taxpayer.</p>
                            <p>We have regional taxes too, for example, council tax. This is collected by the local government like Edinburgh Council. The money is spent on the local level, like bin collection, water supply, streetlights etc.</p>

                            <p>Tax normally collected via PAYE, deducted at source on payslips. What about self-employed taxpayers?... they use self-assessment.</p>
                            <p>HMRC notify taxpayer they must file a tax return. It is the taxpayer's responsibility to submit:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Electronic:</b> filed by 31st January following the end of the tax year. For example, tax year for individuals is between 6th April 2024 to 5th April 2025, then filing is the upcoming 31st January 2026.</li>

                            <p>It is the taxpayers responsibility to pay tax, which is also the 31st January. So regardless of whether its online or paper, the payment date is the 31st Janurary at the end of the tax year.</p>

                            <p>The POA that is due to be paid, is based on the taxpayers previous years tax liability paid at source, plus Class 4 NICs from previous year too. However, there is no POAs if the previous year liability was less than Â£1,000 or 80%+ was taxed from the source. The 3rd and final payment, is the difference between what's been paid minus what's due - this is known as a "Balancing Payment".</p>
                            <p>Here is an example:</p>

                                <li>If the previous year's tax liability is Â£2,000 and 50% was already collected via PAYE, POAs are needed. (more than Â£1,000 and less than 80%)</li>
                                <li>If the previous year's tax liability is Â£800, no POAs are needed (less than Â£1,000)</li>
                                <li>If the previous year's tax liability is Â£2,000, 85% was collected via PAYE, no POAs are needed (over 80%)</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Here is an expansion of each:</p>
                            <p><b><u>Failure to Notify</u></b></p>
                            <p>Notification must be made to HMRC within 6 months of the end of the tax year (i.e., 5th October) - but this is only if it's the first time of notification. If HMRC are already aware of self-assessment (i.e., done a self-assessment before) this is not applicable. The penalty regime for this encompases a range of taxes, including: income tax, corporation tax, and VAT.</p>
                            <p>If there is a reasonable excuse for the failure to notify, HMRC may reduce, or forefit the penalty all together.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For a "deliberate and concealed" failed to notify, where the failure is deliberate and the taxpayer has attempted to conceal it, the percentage is 100%.</li>
                                <li>For a "deliberate but not concealed" failure to notify, the percentage is 70%.</li>
                                <li>For a "not deliberate, nor concealed" failure to notify, the percentage is 30%.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b><u>Late Submission</u></b></p>
                            <p>The penalty regime which applies to the late filing of a self assessment tax return is currently as follows:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A Â£100 penalty is charged as soon as a tax return is late (by a single day, not each day it's late). This applied whether or not the tax liability for the year has been paid and even if the taxpayer has no liability for that year or is owed a tax repayment for the year.</li>
                                <li>If a return is more than 3 months late, HMRC may charge a penalty of Â£10 per day whilst the return remains outstanding (up to a maximum of Â£900).</li>
                                <li>If a return is more than 6 months late, another penalty arises equal to the greater of Â£300 and 5% of the tax liability for the year.</li>
                                <li>If a return is more than 12 months late, a further penalty arises, again equal to the greater of Â£300 and 5% of the tax liability for the year. However, if the information is deliberately withheld, the 5% goes to 70% instead. It rises to 100% instead if the information is found to be withheld both deliberately and concealed. If the taxpayer discloses the withheld information, the higher penalties may be reduced.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Again, these penalties may be reduced or made forefit if the taxpayer has a reasonable excuse, for example, serious illness, in hospital etc.</p>
                            <p><b><u>Incorrect Submission</u></b></p>
                            <p>This penalty regime applies if an incorrect return leads to an understatement (where the taxpayer pays less tax) of the amount of tax due, and the inaccuracy is either careless or deliberate. It also applies if the taxpayer fails to take reasonable steps to notify HMRC of this fact within 30 days.</p>
                            <p>The penalty is in the form of a percentage of lost revenue.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For a "deliberate and concealed" inaccuracy, the penalty is 100%.</li>
                                <li>For a "deliberate but not concealed" inaccuracy, the penalty is 70%.</li>
                                <li>For a "not deliberate, not concealed" inaccuracy, the penalty is 30%.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These penalties can be reduced if the taxpayer discloses the infringement, and these reductions are greater if the disclosure is umprompted than if prompted.</p>
                            <p><b><u>Late Payment</u></b></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If all or part of a balancing payment remains unpaid more than 30 days after the due date, the penalty is 5% of the amount unpaid. The "penalty date" (the date on which the penalty is charged) is the date which falls 31 days after the due date of payment.</li>
                                <li>If any of the balancing payment is not paid within the 5 month period beginning on the penalty date, there is another penalty equal to 5% of the amount still unpaid.</li>
                                <li>Finally, if any of the balancing payment is not paid within the 12 month period beginning on the penalty date, there is a further 5%.</li>
                                <li>If a taxpayer is liable to a late payment penalty, HMRC must issue the taxpayer with a penalty notice. Late payment penalties are due for payment within the 30 day period beginning with the day on which the penalty notice is served.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Note that late payment penalties do not apply to POAs.</p>
                            <p><b><u>Interest on Overdue Tax</u></b></p>
                            <p>Interest on overdue POAs, balancing payments and penalties are calculated as follows:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>In the case of late POAs and balancing payments, interest runs from the due date of payment up to the date on which the tax is actually paid.</li>
                                <li>In the case of discovery assessments and amendments to self assessment, interest runs from the date on which the balancing payment is due for the year to which the assessment relates even though the tax itself might not be due for payment until a later date.</li>
                                <li>Interest on a penalty runs from the date of payment for that penalty.</li>
                                <li>Interest is calculated on a daily basis at the official Bank of England rate plus 2.5% (currently 5.25% + 2.5% = 7.75% pa). Note that it's possible HMRC use a denominator of 366 in such calculations, whether or not a leap year is involved.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><b><u>Enquiries</u></b></p>
                            <p>HMRC may enquire into any tax return. The usual reason for opening an enquiry is the suspicion that something is wrong with the return. However, some enquiry cases may be selected at random and HMRC is under no obligation to justify the opening of an enquiry to state whether or not the case has been chosen randomly. Note that:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If a tax return is filed by the due date, an enquiry cannot usually begin more than 12 months after the date on which the return was filed. This means that the "enquiry window" for a return which is filed early closes correspondingly early.</li>
                                <li>If a return is filed late or is amended after the date on which the return was due to be filed, the enquiry window is extended until the quarter day which follows the first anniversary of the date on which the return or amendment was filed. For this purpose, the quarter days are 31st January, 30th April, 31st July, and 31st October.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b><u>Amendments</u></b></p>
                            <p>HMRC are empowered to correct a tax return (so as to rectify any obvious errors or omissions or anything else that is believed to be incorrect) within 9 months of the date on which the return is filed. Similarly, the taxpayer has the right to amend their tax return within 12 months of the filing date for that return.</p>
                            <p><b><u>Appeals</u></b></p>
                            <p>Taxpayers have the right of appeal against many HMRC decisions. For example, a taxpayer may appeal against a discovery assessment or against an HMRC amendment to a self assessment. The main features of the appeals system are as follows:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>An appeal must be sent to HMRC in writing within 30 days of the dispute decision.</li>
                                <li>The taxpayer may also apply to postpone payment of all or part of any tax which is payable aas a result of the decision, though interest will continue to accrue in the postponed amount until the appeal is settled. However, postponement is generally not available if the appeal relates to the use of a tax avoidance scheme covered by the DOTAS rules or arises in connection with arrangements which have been counteracted by HMRC under the GAAR.</li>
                                <li>On receiving an appeal, HMRC considers the taxpayer's reasons for disputing the decision. Most appeals are settled by discussion and agreement at this stage.</li>
                                <li>If the taxpayer and HMRC are unable to agree, the taxpayer will usually be offered an internal review of the decision. A taxpayer who wishes to accept this offer must normally do so within 30 days. An internal review is carried out by an HMRC officer who has not previously involved with the dispute decision and is usually completed within 45 days. The review officer then writes to the taxpayer to imform them of the review's conclusions.</li>
                                <li>A taxpayer who rejects the offer of an internal review may appeal to a tribunal within 30 days of the date of the offer letter. Otherwise, an appeal to a tribunal may be made within 30 days of the date of the review conclusion letter.</li>
                                <li>Most appeals are dealt with by the Tax Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal. However, more complex appeals may be heard by the Tax and Chancery Chamber of the Upper Tribunal. The Upper Tribunal also hears appeals against First-tier Tribunal decisions.</li>
                                <li>If either HMRC or the person concerned is dissatisfied with a decision made by the Upper Tribunal, a dispute on a point of law may be referred to the Court of Appeal.</li>
                                <li>The costs of brining an appeal before the First-tier Tribunal are usually fairly modest. Parties to the appeal usually bear their own costs and so a taxpayer who loses an appeal is not normally required to pay HMRC's costs (unless the taxpayer has acted wholly unreasonably). The costs of taking an appeal to higher authority can be very high and an unsuccessful taxpayer may be required to pay HMRC's costs in defending the appeal as well as their own costs.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b><u>Record Keeping</u></b></p>
                            <p>Taxpayers are required to keep proper records so that they can make an accurate tax return and (if neccessary) substantiate the figures entered on the return. A taxpayer who is in business or who lets property must normally preserve these records for five years after the 31st January which follows the end of the tax year concerned.</p>
                            <p>Otherwise, records must be preserved for 12 months after the 31st January which follows the end of the tax year. For example, records for tax year 24/25 must normally be retained under 31st January 2031 by a taxpayer who is in business or who lets property and until 31st January 2027 otherwise. Failure to do either is a penalty of Â£3,000.</p>
