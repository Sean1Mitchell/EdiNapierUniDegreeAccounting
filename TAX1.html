                            <p><b>UK Taxes</b></p>
                            <p>The UK taxation system is composed of a number of different taxes, some of which are direct, and indirect.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Direct:</b> Are charged on income, profits or gains and are either deducted at source, or paid directly to the tax authorities. The main direct taxes which are payable by individuals are income tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax. The main direct taxe which are payable by companies is corporation tax. All of these direct taxes are administered by HMRC, which was formed in Aprial 2005 when the Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise were merged together. National Insurance contributions, which can also be regarded as a form of direct taxation, are administered by the NICs and Employer Office of HMRC.</li>
                                <li><b>Indirect:</b> Are taxes on spending. They are charged when a taxpayer buys an item and are paid to the vendor as part of the purchase price of that item. It is then the vendor's duty to pass the tax on to the tax authorities. The indirect taxes include value added tax (VAT), stamp duty, customs duties and the excise duties levied on alchohol, tobacco and petrol. The only indirect tax considered in this book is VAT, which is also administered by HMRC.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </div>

                            <p><b>Sources of Tax Law</b></p>
                            <p>There is no single source if UK taxation law. The basic rules are laid down in Acts of Parliament but it is left to the courts to interpret these Acts and to provide much of the detail of the tax system. In addition, HMRC issues a variety of statements which explain how the law is implemented in practice. These statements explain the tax authorities' interpretation of the law and will be adhered to unless successfully challenged by the courts.</p>
                            <p><b>Status Law</b></p>
                            <p>The basic rules of the UK tax system are embodied in a number of tax statutes or Acts of Parliament. The main statues currently in force for each tax are as follows:</p>

                            <p><b>European Union Law</b></p>
                            <p>Until the 1st February 2020, the UK was a member of the European Union (EU) and was required to comply with EU laws. Member states of the EU do not adopt a common tax system but must implement EU directives, some of which are concerned with taxation (principally VAT). As of the 1st February 2020, the UK entered a transition period during which EU law continued to apply. But in this period came to an end on the 31st December 2020 and EU law ceased to have affect in the UK from the 1st January 2021.</p>
                            <p>Although the UK has now left the EU, some aspects of the UK tax system were originally devised so as to comply with EU directives and these will continue unless amended or repealed by subsequent legislation. Much of the UK VAT law falls into this category. Furthermore, when the UK was a member of the EU, it was necessary to seek EU "State aid" approval for UK tax-advantaged schemes such as the Enterprice Investment Scheme or the R&D tax credits scheme. These schemes had to be designed within the contraints of EU law, but is now at liberty to amend such schemes or to introduce new ones as it sees fit.</p>
                            <p><b>Case Law</b></p>
                            <p>Over the years, taxpayers and the tax authorities have frequently disagreed over the interpretation of the tax Acts. As a result, many thousands of tax cases have been brought before the courts. The decisions made by judges in these cases form an important part of the tax law of the UK and some of the more significant cases are referred to in this book.</p>
                            <p><b>Statements made by the tax authorities</b></p>
                            <p>The main statement and other documents produced by HM Revenue and Customs as a guide to the law on taxation are as follows:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Statements of Practice:</b> An HMRC Statement of Practice (SP) sets out the HMRC interpretation of tax legislation and clarifies the way in which the law will be applied in practice. For example, SP 4/97 (the 4th SP issued in 1997) deals with the taxation treatment of commissions, cashbacks and discounts.</li>
                                <li><b>Extra-Statutory Concessions:</b> An Extra-Statutory Concession (ESC) consists of a relaxation which gives taxpayers a reduction in liability to which they are not entitled under the strict letter of the law. In general, concessions are made so as to resolve anomalies or to relieve hardship. For example, ESC A91 deals with the taxation treatment of living accomondation provided by reason of employment. A process of giving statutory effect to certain ESCs began in 2009. This is generally being done by means of statutory instruments.</li>
                                <li><b>Announcements:</b> Announcements are issued by HMRC throughout the year on a wide variety of tax-related subjects. Of especial interest are the documents issued on budget day, which provide a detailed explanation of the budget proposals.</li>

                            <p>The Tax Year</p>
                            <p>The changes to the tax system that are proposed in the annual budget speech are usually intended to take effect as from the start of the next year. Tax years for individuals and for companies are identified as follows:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Individuals:</b> A tax year from the 6th April to the following 5th April. For instance, tax year 2023-24 began on the 6th April 2023 and ended on the 5th April 2024. Tax years are also referred to as fiscal years or years of assessment.</li>
                                <li><b>Companies:</b> A corporation tax financial year runs from the 1st April to the following 31st March and is identified by the year in which it begins. For instance, the financial year referred to as FY2023 began on the 1st April 2023 and ended on the 31st March 2024.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>This book takes into account the provisions of Finance Act 2024 (which is based upon the Autumn Statement of November 2023) and Finance (No.2) Act 2024 (which is based upon the March 2024 Budget) and describes the UK taxation system for fiscal year 2024-25 and corporation tax financial year FY2024.</p>
                            <p>*Finance Act 2024 received Royal Assent on the 22nd February 2024, and Finance (No.2) Act 2024 received Royal Assent on the 24th May 2024. The timing of the annual budeet has varied in recent years but, at present, the budget normally takes place in March of each year. However, there is also an Autumn Statement in October or November. This statement is largely concerned with public spending plans but usually introduces further tax changes.</p>

                            <p>The Structure of the HMRC</p>
                            <p>HMRC consists of a large body of civil servants which is headed by the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs. The Commissioners are appointed by His Majesty The King in accordance with recommendations that are made by the Treasury. This Government department, which has overall responsibility for the public finances of the UK, is directed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The principal functions of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs are as follows:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>to implement the law relating to direct and indirect taxation.</li>
                                <li>to provide advice to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on taxation matters.</li>
                                <li>to administer the divisions and offices into which HMRC is organised.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The routine work of HMRC is carried out by officials known as Officers of Revenue and Customs. With regard to direct taxation, the main function of these officials is generally to check a taxpayer's own self-assessment of the tax liability and then to ensure that the correct amount of tax is paid. The functions of HMRC with regard to indirect taxation are explained later in this book.</p>
                            <p>HMRC has specialist offices which deal with such matters as pensions schemes, charities and so forth but most of the day-to-day work relating to direct taxation takes place in regional centres. These centres are responsible for routine assessment and collection of tax and for ensuring that taxpayers comply with tax regulations. At one time, HMRC had 170 local offices but these have now been consolidated into fourteen regional centres. Support for taxpayers who need help with their tax affairs is provided by means of specialist expert advice either given over the telephone (or online) or delivered by mobile advisors at convenient locations in the community.</p>

                            <p>The remainder of this chapter describes the administration system which is used to assess an individual's liability to income tax and capital gains tax in each tax year. This system is referred to as "Self-Assessment". Under this system, the taxpayer is primarily responsible for ensuring that:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The tax liability for each tax year is properly assessed, and</li>
                                <li>The correct amount of tax is paid on the due date or dates.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Subsequent chapters of this book explain the administration systems which are used for the purposes of corporation tax, inheritance tax and VAT.</p>

                            <p><b>Self Assessment</b></p>
                            <p>If an individual's tax liability for a tax year cannot be collected entirely by deductions at source or via the PAYE system, then the liability must be formally assessed. The starting point in the assessment process is usually the completion of a self assessment tax return. The annual procedure is as follows:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>At the end of every tax year, a statutory "notice to file" is normally issued to each taxpayer who is required to submit a self assessment tax return. Such a notice requires that a return is made and delivered to HMRC either on paper or electronically. paper tax return forms may be obtained by phoning HMRC. Voluntary tax returns (i.e., without the notice being given) are accepted and valid.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>* In certain circumstances, HMRC is empowered to make an assessment of an individual's income tax or capital gains tax liability without that person being first required to complete a tax return. This "simple assessment" procedure may be used in straightforward cases where HMRC already has sufficient information about the individual to make the assessment. The Government intends to replace tax returns with online "digitial tax accounts" as part of the "Making Tax Digital" project.</p>
