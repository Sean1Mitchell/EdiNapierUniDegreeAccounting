                        <h1>Introduction</h1>
                        <p>Capital investment refers to spending long-term assets that will benefit the business for more than one year. These assets either: generate revenue (e.g., launching a new product line), or reduce cost (e.g., new machinery that cuts labour). The key point is the capital investment requires spending money now and receiving benefits later. This time gap is what makes appraisal techniques essential.</p>
                        <p>Capital investment is critial because:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>large Capital Outlay</b> - projects often require substantial upfront spending.</li>
                            <li><b>No Immediate Gain</b> - cash only goes out in Year 0; benefits arrive years later.</li>
                            <li><b>Funding Limits</b> - companies always have more potential projects than available money, which leads to capital rationing.</li>
                            <li><b>Irreversibility</b> - once a factory or machine is purchased, reversing the decision is extremely costly.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The investment process - which is before the appraisal happens, follows a structured organisational process:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Search for Opportunities</b> - spotting efficiency improvements, new markets, product innovations.</li>
                            <li><b>Generation of Ideas</b> - brainstorming alternatives.</li>
                            <li><b>Development of Proposals</b> - collecting cash flow estimates and technical details.</li>
                            <li><b>Screening</b> - removing projects misaligned with strategy.</li>
                            <li><b>Appraisal</b> - using tools like NPV/IRR to financially evaluate.</li>
                            <li><b>Agreement of Capital Budget</b> - enior management allocates funds.</li>
                            <li><b>Strategy Alignment</b> - ensuring chosen projects support long-term objectives.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Remember – the underlaying objective is shareholder wealth maximisation – investment appraisal exists to identify projects that increase shareholder value.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h1>Investment Appraisal Methods</h1>
                        <p>Before diving into each method, understand that appraisal techniques are tools to determine whether a project will increase value.</p>
                        <p>The four key methods are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Accounting Rate of Return (ARR).</li>
                            <li>Payback Period.</li>
                            <li>Net Present Value (NPV).</li>
                            <li>Internal Rate of Return (IRR).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The first two are simpler and do not discount cash flows, but NPV and IRR are more advanced and account for the time value of money.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="content-box" id="netpresentvalue">
                    <div>
                        <h1>Net Present Value (NPV)</h1>
                        <p>NPV represents the difference between the present value of future cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows.</p>
                        <p>The decision rule is that if NPV is equal to or more than 0, we accept it. But if it’s under 0 (in the negative), we reject it. This method is considered the most reliable because the result is in month terms, not percentages, and directly measures wealth creation.</p>
                        <p>How does it work? Future cash flows are discounted back to todays using a discount rate (usually the cost of capital). For example:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>We calculate to net cash flow (i.e., income - expenses).</li>
                            <li>We then multiple by discount rate to get present value.</li>
                            <li>We then sum up all period (i.e., 5 years) to get total NPV.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>There are rules though (and exam reminders):</p>
                        <p><u>Include:</u></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Only extra cash caused by the project.</li>
                            <li>Cash inflows and outflows.</li>
                            <li>Working capital changes.</li>
                            <li>Tax effects.</li>
                            <li>Scrap values.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><u>Exclude:</u></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sunk costs (money already spent).</li>
                            <li>Depreciation (non-cash).</li>
                            <li>Financing costs (interest, dividends – already in discount rate).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><u>Timing Rules:</u></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cash flows occur at year-end unless stated.</li>
                            <li>In inflation is included, use money discount rate.</li>
                            <li>If using real cash flows, use real discount rate.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><u>Relationship:</u></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>(1 + real rate) x (1 + inflation) = (1 + money rate)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="content-box" id="internalrateofreturn">
                    <div>
                        <h1>Internal Rate of Return (IRR)</h1>
                        <p>IRR is the discount rate that makes the NPV of a project equal to 0. It tells us the projects annual percentage of return. The decision rule is that if IRR is higher than the cost of capital, we accept, and reject if it's less.</p>
                        <p>How do we work it out?</p>
                        <p>We take the initial outlay (cost) and expected returns over a period (say 3 Years), we then multiple by the discount rate to get cumulative cash flow of the project over the period, i.e., total NPV.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, we need to total NPV of the project, however, we want to see the total NPV of the project of two different discount factors. One must be positive NPV, and one negative NPV.</p>
                        <p>For example, let's say we have a discount factor of 10% which gives a NPV of £1,526.98 and another discount factor of 25% which gives a NPV of -£304.64.</p>
                        <p>We take the IRR formula and find:</p>
                        <p>IRR = r1 + (NPV1 / (NPV1 - NPV2)) x (r2 - r1)</p>
                        <p>Where:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>r1 = positive NPV</li>
                            <li>r2 = negative NPV</li>
                            <li>NPV1 = Positive NPV</li>
                            <li>NPV2 = Negative NPV</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>IRR = 10%+(1526.98/(1526.98-(-304.64)))*(25%-10%)</p>
                        <p>IRR = 23%</p>
                        <p>Therefore, we have a positive IRR of 23% which is higher than the discount rate of 10%. So we accept the project.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h1>Capital Rationing & Probability Index (PI)</h1>
                        <p>It is rare than a company will have just one positive NPV project to take on due to funding constraints, therefore, capital rationing and PI are used to determine which positive ones to accept.</p>
                        <p>There are two types of capital rationing:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Soft</b> - Internal Limits.</li>
                            <li><b>Hard</b> - External Financial Conatraints.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are two tools used for rationing:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Probability Index (PI)</b> - where PI = Gross PV / Initial Outlay.</li>
                            <li><b>Benefit-Cost Ration</b> - where C/B = NPV / Initial Outlay.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Project A</b>: outlay of 7,000, NPV of 1,527, and GPV of 8,527: gives a PI of 1.218 and C/B of 0.218.</li>
                            <li><b>Project B</b>: outlay of 12,000, NPV of 1,723, and GPV of 13,723: gives a PI of 1.143 and C/B of 0.143.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Project A produced a 21.8p return per £1 invested, whereas, Project B produced a 14.3p return per £1 invested.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, rationing tells us that we should accept Project A as it offers a higher return.</p>
                        <p>Another example would be:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Project A</b>: outlay of 500, NPV of 125, IRR of 28%: giving a PI of 1.25</li>
                            <li><b>Project B</b>: outlay of 250, NPV of 75, IRR of 22%: giving a PI of 1.30</li>

                        <h1>Asset Replacement Decisions</h1>
                        <p>An asset replacement decision is a capital budgeting decision that determines whether an existing asset is to be replaced, and if so, when.</p>
                        <p>The objective is to maximise shareholder value by minimising long-term costs or maximising net cash flows.</p>
                        <p>If machines have different useful lives, comparing NPV's alone is misleading, and for this there are two solutions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC) Method</b> - which is generally perferred due to it's simplicity. It converts the total NPV of costs into uniform annual cost. EAC = PV(cost) / Annuity Factor. (choose the machine with the lower EAC).</li>
                            <li><b>Least Common Multiple (LCM) Method</b> - which extends common life lenghts from 2 and 3 years, to 6 years.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For example: (EAC)</p>
                        <p>Machine X:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cost of: 120,000. Life Cycle of: 3 Yrs. Running Costs of: 24,000.</li>
                            <li>Cash Outflows of: 120, 24, 24, 24.</li>
                            <li>Discount Rate of 10%.</li>
                            <li>Giving a PV(cost) of: 120, 21.82, 19.83, 18.03.</li>
                            <li>Giving a Total PV(cost) of: 179.7 (or £179,684).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Machine Y:</p>
                        <ul>

                            <li>Discount Rate of: 10%.</li>
                            <li>Giving a PV(cost) of: 60, 32.73, 29.75.</li>
                            <li>Giving a Total PV(cost) of: 122.5 (or £122,479).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Comparison:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Machine X</b>: 179,684 (Total Life Cost) / 2.487 = 72,254 (Per Year Cost)</li>
                            <li><b>Machine Y</b>: 122,479 (Total Life Cost) / 1.736 = 70,571 (Per Year Cost)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The 2.487 and 1.736 are called PV of Annuity. We find this by using the following formula:</p>
                        <p>(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r</p>
                        <p>Where:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>r = Discount Rate.</li>
                            <li>n = Number of Years.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In conclusion, it's a cheaper cost going with Machine Y (70,571), so we choose that over machine X (72,254). Because once again, choosing it minimises cost, thus, maximising shareholder value.</p>
                        <p>For example: (LCM)</p>
                        <p>Again, this is similar to that of EAC, only the period (life cycle) is extended to 6 years.</p>

                        <p>It's worth mentioning that with EAC and LCM: We are looking to take the lowest of the per year cost, but you'll notice the total life cost changes based on which we use - that is not important. Focus on the per year cost, and choose the machine/s with the lowest.</p>

                        <p>Net Present Value (NPV) requires cash flows, but tax is paid on taxable profit, which reduces cash flows, therefore, taxation must be included to account for this.</p>
                        <p>Capital Allowances are made for this and tax relief on plant and machinery includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Annual Investment Allowance (AIA)</b> - gives 100% 1st relief.</li>
                            <li><b>Written Down Allowance (WDA)</b> - gives relief on a 18% reducing balance basis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When asset are sold:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Balancing Allowance (BA)</b> - extra relief. CA claimed + net cost of asset = positive.</li>
                            <li><b>Balancing Charge (BC)</b> - extra taxable income. CA claimed + net cost of asset = negative.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For example:</p>

                        <p>With an initial investment of 14,000 with WDA at 18% reducing balance per year, we end with:</p>
